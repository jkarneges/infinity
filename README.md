# Infinity

Infinity is a role-playing game for the Game Boy Color handheld game console, developed by Affinix Software primarily between the years 1999 and 2001. The game is incomplete and should be considered alpha/preview quality. See the [Infinity website](http://infinity-gbc.org) for the full announcement regarding the project release as well as a downloadable ROM file.

## Building

Building the game requires a unix-like environment, GBDK, [Yasm](https://yasm.tortall.net/Download.html), as well as custom build utilities that you'll need to compile. On Windows, you can use [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).

Clone our GBDK repository, which contains tweaks for it to build on modern systems. Build and install it somewhere. Below installs to `/home/user/gbdk/sdk`:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/infinity-gbc/gbdk.git
cd gbdk
GBDK_PATH=~/gbdk
make SDK_DIR=$GBDK_PATH
make SDK_DIR=$GBDK_PATH install
```

Clone the Infinity repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/infinity-gbc/infinity.git
cd infinity
INFINITY=`pwd`
```

Patch and build the GBDK library:

```sh
cd $GBDK_PATH/sdk/gbz80-gb/2.1.5
patch -p0 < $INFINITY/tools/gbdk_infinity.diff
cd lib
make
```

Put the compiler in your `$PATH`:

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:$GBDK_PATH/sdk/gbz80-gb/2.1.5/bin
```

Build the toolchain:

```sh
cd $INFINITY
cd tools/toolchain
make
cd ../../
```

Build the game!

```sh
make
```

If all goes well, the game will be built as `build/j.gb`.
